# The Wemunity project 
An open innovation project. Can those that recovered from Corona Virus Disease (and acquired immunity) register to help the sick in their local communities? 

## Project background

The Wemunity project is initiated by New and Deloitte Digital, based on an idea to utilize immunity of individuals strategically in the civic response to the Covid 19 outbreak. The idea was initially shared in social media. Given the positive feedback from medical expertise, a group of technologists and designers jointly decided to explore this further. 

The current ambition is to prepare a system for registry and validation of immune helpers. The system will be made available as soon as tests can confirm immunity. We work to validate the initial concept and plan to open source the project. At the current stage any technical and financial support is welcome.
